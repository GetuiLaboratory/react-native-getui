# Theme
 
The React Native component's style is usually defined as a static variable along with the component itself. This makes it easy to build self contained components that always look and behave in the same way. On the other hand, it complicates building themeable (or skinnable) components that could have multiple styles that can be customized without touching the component source code.
`@shoutem/theme` is built to address that problem. With themes, you can target specific components in your app and customize them through one file, just like you would do it with CSS on the web.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save @shoutem/theme
```

## Docs

All the documentation is available on the [Developer portal](http://shoutem.github.io/docs/ui-toolkit/theme/introduction).

## Examples

Use [Shoutem UI](https://github.com/shoutem.theme), set of components which are made to be customizable by Theme, to see how to work with it.

Create new React Native project:

```bash
$ react-native init HelloWorld
```

Install `@shoutem/ui` and `@shoutem/theme` and link them in your project:

```bash
$ cd HelloWorld
$ npm install --save @shoutem/ui
$ npm install --save @shoutem/theme
$ rnpm link
```

Now, simply copy the following to your `index.ios.js` file of React Native project:

```JavaScript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Dimensions } from 'react-native';
import { StyleProvider } from '@shoutem/theme';
import {
  Card,
  Image,
  View,
  Subtitle,
  Caption,
} from '@shoutem/ui';

const window = Dimensions.get('window');

const Colors = {
  BACKGROUND: '#ffffff',
  SHADOW: '#000000',
};

const MEDIUM_GUTTER = 15;

const theme = {
  'shoutem.ui.View': {
    '.h-center': {
      alignItems: 'center',
    },

    '.v-center': {
      justifyContent: 'center',
    },

    '.flexible': {
      flex: 1,
    },

    flexDirection: 'column',
  },

  'shoutem.ui.Card': {
    'shoutem.ui.View.content': {
      'shoutem.ui.Subtitle': {
        marginBottom: MEDIUM_GUTTER,
      },

      flex: 1,
      alignSelf: 'stretch',
      padding: 10,
    },

    width: (180 / 375) * window.width,
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'flex-start',
    backgroundColor: Colors.BACKGROUND,
    borderRadius: 2,
    shadowColor: Colors.SHADOW,
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowOffset: { width: 1, height: 1 },
  },

  'shoutem.ui.Image': {
    '.medium-wide': {
      width: (180 / 375) * window.width,
      height: 85,
    },

    flexDirection: 'column',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    resizeMode: 'cover',
    backgroundColor: Colors.BACKGROUND,
  },
};

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <StyleProvider style={theme}>
        <View styleName="flexible vertical v-center h-center">
          <Card>
            <Image
              styleName="medium-wide"
              source={{ uri: 'http://shoutem.github.io/img/ui-toolkit/examples/image-12.png' }}
            />
            <View styleName="content">
              <Subtitle numberOfLines={4}>
                Lady Gaga Sings National Anthem at Super Bowl 50
              </Subtitle>
              <Caption>21 hours ago</Caption>
            </View>
          </Card>
        </View>
      </StyleProvider>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorld);
```

Finally, run the app!

```bash
$ react-native run-ios
```
